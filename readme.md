# LinkedIn Connect - Automated Invitations Script

This JavaScript script allows you to automate the process of sending connection invitations on LinkedIn. It is designed to be used within the browser console (Chrome DevTools) and sends connection requests to people matching your search criteria.

**How to Use:**
1. Visit the LinkedIn website and log in to your LinkedIn account.
2. Open the browser console by pressing the key combination: `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or manually open Chrome DevTools).
3. Copy the provided JavaScript code from the [github/linkedinAutomationScript](linkedin-connect.js)repository and paste it into the console.
4. Customize the settings as needed (see the "Settings" section below).
5. Press Enter to run the script, and it will automatically send connection invitations.

**Settings:**
The script includes a setting called `countOfPagesScrolled`, which determines the number of pages the script will scroll down to load more profiles. By default, it is set to 5 pages, but you can modify it to any other number according to your preferences. Keep in mind that LinkedIn allows a maximum of 3000 connection requests, so use the script responsibly.

**Important Note:**
- Use this script responsibly and in compliance with LinkedIn's terms of service. Aggressive automation might lead to account restrictions or bans.
- The script is provided as-is and may require updates if LinkedIn changes its website structure.
- The script sends connection invitations based on predefined criteria. Always verify the invitations sent and ensure they align with your networking strategy.
